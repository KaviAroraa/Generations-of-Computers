        <font face='Chalkboard SE' size='5' color='yellow'><li>A second generation of computers, through the <i>late 1950s and 1960s</i> featured <u><b>circuit boards</b> filled with individual transistors and magnetic core memory</u>.</font> <br>

        <font face='Chalkboard SE' size='5' color='green'><li>The <b>University of Manchester's</b> experimental <u>Transistor Computer</u> was first operational in November 1953 and it is widely believed to be the <b>first transistor computer to come into operation anywhere in the world.</b></font> <br> <br>
        <font face='Chalkboard SE' size='5' color='orange'><li>There were <u>two versions</u> of the Transistor Computer, <b>the prototype</b>, operational in 1953, and the <b>full-size version</b>, commissioned in April 1955.</font> <br> <br>
        <font face='Chalkboard SE' size='5' color='purple'><li>The 1953 machine had <b><u>92 point-contact transistors and 550 diodes</u></b>, manufactured by <b>STC</b>.</font> <br> <br>
        <font face='Chalkboard SE' size='5' color='pink'><li>It had a <b>48-bit machine word</b>. The 1955 machine had a total of <b><u>200 point-contact transistors and 1300 point diodes</u></b>, which resulted in a <u>power consumption of 150 watts</u>.</font> <br> <br>
        <font face='Chalkboard SE' size='5' color='white'><li>There were considerable <i>reliability problems</i> with the early batches of transistors and the <u>average error-free run</u> in 1955 was only <b>1.5 hours.</b></font> <br> <br>
        <font face='Chalkboard SE' size='5' color='peach'><li>The Computer also used a <u>small number of tubes in its clock generator</u>, so it was <i>not the first fully transistorized machine.</i></font> <br> <br>
        <font face='Chalkboard SE' size='5' color='brown'><li>The design of a full-size Transistor Computer was subsequently adopted by the <b>Manchester firm of Metropolitan-Vickers</b>, who <u>changed all the circuits to use more reliable junction transistors.</u></font> <br> <br>
        <font face='Chalkboard SE' size='5' color='aquamarine'><li>The <i>production version</i> was known as the <b>Metrovick 950</b> and was built from 1956 to the extent of <u>six or seven machines</u>, which were "<i>used commercially within the company" or "mainly for internal use</i>".</font> <br> <br>

        <font face='Georgia' size='5' color='white'>The period of <b>first generation</b> was from <b>1946-1959.</b> <br> 
        The computers of first generation used <u>vacuum tubes</u> as the basic components for <u>memory and circuitry</u> for the <b>Central Processing Unit</b>>. <br>
        These tubes, like electric bulbs, <i>produced a lot of heat</i>> and the installations used to fuse frequently. So, they were <u>very expensive and only large organizations were able to afford it</u>. <br>
        In this generation, mainly <b>batch processing operating system</b> was used. Punch cards, paper tape, and magnetic tape was used as <i>input and output devices</i>. The computers in this generation used <b>machine code</b> as the <i>programming language</i>.
